              <h3>Course Information</h3>
              <h4><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h4>
              <p>
                At no point during this course will you wager real money. We
                understand that betting is a sensitive topic for some and you
                might have issues with the ethical implications, please let us
                know. We will be focusing on the probability and statistics
                behind betting.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Course Objectives</strong></h4>
              <p>
                1) Understanding the rules of poker <br />2) Understand basic
                and advanced poker concepts <br />3) Be able to use an
                understanding of poker strategy to play a fundamentally sound
                game <br />4) Be comfortable thinking about hands using correct
                logic, being able to apply that logic more generally to other
                games and circumstances.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <h4><strong>Assignments and Grades</strong></h4>
              <p>
                <strong>Lecture Attendance (30%)</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                The concepts covered in this course are cumulative, so missing a lecture creates a chance to fall
                behind. While slide decks will be made public, there is no guarantee of course capture so
                attending class is the best way to learn the material. Active participation is encouraged, and
                students always have the opportunity to ask questions during the lecture.
                <br /><br />
                Attendance will be taken at the end of each class.
                <br /><br />
                Please let an Instructor know before the beginning of class if you will be absent.
                <br /><br />
                After 2 unexcused absences, each absence will result in a 3% penalty to the total grade.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Playing Session Attendance (10%)</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                The second part of the lecture will involve short sessions to practice concepts using play money.
                There is no punishment for poor performance in the playing sessions, as the goal is simply
                improvement. These will be tracked by participation in the playing session’s medium (Likely PokerNow)
                <br /><br />
                The first 2 playing session absences will be automatically excused.
                <br /><br />
                Each session beyond that will result in a 0.5% penalty to the final grade.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Homework (40%)</strong>
                <br /><br />
                Homework is given on a weekly basis, created upon the material covered in the previous week. 
                Homework will be assigned on Monday after the first lecture and due the following Monday.
                <br /><br />
                Graded based on completeness, difficult questions will be reviewed during the next lecture
                <br /><br />
                Solutions provided and explained online after the due date
                <br /><br />
                Can be submitted up to 1 week late for half credit
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Final Project (20%)</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                The final project in this course will be a hand analysis of 3 hands the student has played during
                practice sessions, covering their reasoning on each street given the strength of their own hand
                against their opponent’s perceived range. This will be grade by effort and general thought
                process rather than perfect accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Final Grade</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                An overall percentage of 70% or higher will Pass. In other words, if one puts effort into the
                course they will pass. If you need accommodations or have any extenuating circumstances,
                please reach out to the course staff. We promise to be reasonable and do not want grades to be a
                concern for any student engaging with the course.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Course Description</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Introduction to Poker will introduce concepts of Statistics and game theory to students
                through the game of poker. Each week, students will focus on a different topic related to poker,
                spending time learning each street in a hand and developing heuristics they can use to generalize
                the theory they learned.
                <br /><br />
                After learning the information associated with preflop play, the flop, the turn, and the river,
                we will take a general look at the game and apply the information learned to specific hands or
                examples to teach a very specific concept, known as toy games.
                <br /><br />
                Knowledge of poker is an important skill to develop problem solving ability, take a
                hands-on approach to statistics, and is a common test for students interested in quantitative finance
                or related fields.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Lecture Activities</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Each class is split into two parts: an approximately 90 minute lecture on topics or concepts
                surrounding poker theory, and an approximately half-an-hour long playing session, where students
                will have the opportunity to put these new skills to practice using play money.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Prerequisites</strong></h4>
              <p>
                There are no prerequisites for this course, and prior understanding of poker is neither required nor
                assumed. However, we are looking at situations and general poker theory from a statistical
                perspective, so having taken an introductory statistics course would provide some students a deeper
                understanding.
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Learning Outcomes</strong></h4>
              <p>
                Understand how decisions are made to produce a ‘best result’
                <br /><br />
                Be comfortable with the rules of poker and general etiquette
                <br /><br />
                Apply strategies learned throughout the course to the player's own hands in playing sessions or outside of lecture
                <br /><br />
                Use basic statistical processes to evaluate the risk and reward of any situation
              </p>
              <h4><strong>Resources</strong></h4>
              <p>
